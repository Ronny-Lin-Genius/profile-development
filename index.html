                            My interests in IT are keeping changing, the reason being is probably still lack of overall knowledge in the IT field,
                            at the beginning of learning IT, was interested in game development, was spent 8 months in the library trying to figure
                            out how to use java to developer basic game, did developer some games successfully, but have the worst user interface.
                            but currently are more interested in website development because it looks more useful to me. <br>
                            The reason I Choose RMIT firstly it is one of the greatest universities in Australia, and I was dreaming of going to
                            RMIT when I was a child, and RMIT also offers the best resources for programmers, so I can become the greatest
                            programmer in the world. <br>
                            During the study, I expect to get an overview of all the areas in the IT field. and experience how to study and work in
                            a team.

                            Youtube is always one of the best plateform to gain new knowledge. it is easy to distinguish good or bad content on this

                            what I need to learn, and get to know more people in this field is also important because there are many things can only
                            be taught by people rather than textbooks.

                            Nowadays, almost every business or organization would have its own website, and the problem is there is only 1 website
                            used to represent their organization, for small businesses it probably would be more than enough. But for relatively
                            bigger organizations such as RMIT, as time goes by, they keep adding more and more functionality to their website, it
                            ends up when a user opens the website, countless option in the menu bar shows up, which can be so overwhelming. it would
                            be very common if they couldn't find the links, they want to accomplish their task. so, an FQA page with high-efficiency
                            search functionality is very necessary.

                            The FAQ page would be in the menu bar at the top of the website, when the user clicks it, the microphone shape sign

                            example -"how do pay tuition fee for this semester?" when users stop talking for more than 2 seconds, the system would
                            transfer what user says to text then send to the server. then on the server-side, it would start to search the database
                            base on the keyword that the user asked in his question. once find the most relevant answer from the database, it would
                            send it back to the clients' browser, then show the answer to the user in text form.

                            this kind of system can be applied to websites on any topic, and once a website has this function, the user experience
                            would be much better, so users would find the answer they want more efficiently. because in the traditional FAQ page,
                            all the questions would be included in a list, users have to look at all the questions one by one just to find the
                            question they want to ask. when the user experience gets improve, it can potentially lead to higher profit for a
                            business, and for an organization like RMIT University, this functionality makes student solve their problems more
