                            My deep passion for technology fuels my perpetual curiosity about its functioning. During my leisure time, 
                            I indulge in exploring diverse programming tutorials and the latest technological innovations on YouTube.
                            Apart from that, I love music, movie and various sport.

                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            Nowadays, almost every business or organization would have its own website, and the problem is there is only 1 website
                            used to represent their organization, for small businesses it probably would be more than enough. But for relatively
                            bigger organizations such as RMIT, as time goes by, they keep adding more and more functionality to their website, it
                            ends up when a user opens the website, countless option in the menu bar shows up, which can be so overwhelming. it would
                            be very common if they couldn't find the links, they want to accomplish their task. so, an FQA page with high-efficiency
                            search functionality is very necessary.

                            The FAQ page would be in the menu bar at the top of the website, when the user clicks it, the microphone shape sign
                            would show up to record what the user says, then the user would be able to ask questions about the university, for
                            example -"how do pay tuition fee for this semester?" when users stop talking for more than 2 seconds, the system would
                            transfer what user says to text then send to the server. then on the server-side, it would start to search the database
                            base on the keyword that the user asked in his question. once find the most relevant answer from the database, it would
                            send it back to the clients' browser, then show the answer to the user in text form.

                            What impact will this development have?
                            this kind of system can be applied to websites on any topic, and once a website has this function, the user experience
                            would be much better, so users would find the answer they want more efficiently. because in the traditional FAQ page,
                            all the questions would be included in a list, users have to look at all the questions one by one just to find the
                            question they want to ask. when the user experience gets improve, it can potentially lead to higher profit for a
                            business, and for an organization like RMIT University, this functionality makes student solve their problems more
                            efficiently,
